**MOB FARMS**
============


This mod condenses those multi-hundred or thousand block mob farms,
that take hours to make and more hours to generate resources into one block.
Every mob that drops something useful can be created.
The crafting recipe for all the mob farms is simple as well.
It requires something that the mob drops.
For example, a creeper drops gunpowder.
To make a creeper farm, you need two gunpowder,
five glass panes, stone and a lava bucket.

JEI or something similar is suggested to see recopies.

There is one Mob Farm that is not included in this GitHub. The reason why
is so that you can't find the recipe by looking at the source code. It's a Trade Secret.
You MUST discover it on your own in-game.
